About Project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SAHARA- It's a website that provides emotional service and therapy online 
We made this website from scratch, using HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, Most of the graphics that we used are self-made. 

:volleyball: Tagline: Give and Recieve support and make this world a better place to live
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sahara aims to offer a variety of communities to provide support and personal connection. From this central hub, you can explore and join new communities. A user could benefit and receive expert counselling from the best counsellors, life coaches, relationship counsellors. Some people are hesitant towards having real-time therapy sessions so for them Sahara offers a way to virtually connect with free listeners and psychiatrists. Counselling helps resolves the issues faced by an individual with the added advantage of comfort, affordability and ease.

1.Making the site responsive and lite was a bit challenging.
2.Since this project was made in parts with members sitting at remote locations, assembling parts was a bit difficult.

4.Choosing the right colour palette and the graphics for the website (worth mentioning that some of the graphics are self-made) took time
